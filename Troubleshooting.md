## I'm getting an error that Valheim Dedicated Server is not installed when I start the app

In order to use this application, you must have Valheim Dedicated Server (VDS) installed on your machine. VDS is included for free with your purchase of Valheim. If you have not installed VDS, see the installation guide [here](../Installing-Valheim-Dedicated-Server).

You may also get this warning if you have installed VDS somewhere other than the default Steam directory. If you have installed VDS somewhere else, you can change the path by going to **File > Set Directories** and changing the path for **Valheim Server .EXE**.

## It keeps saying my server name/password is not allowed

Valheim enforces some rules about your server information. It must meet the following requirements:

* Your server name cannot be the same as the name of the world you're hosting
* Your password must be at least 5 characters long
* Your password must not contain either the name of the server or the name of the world you're hosting

## I think something is messed up with my saved settings

You can delete or modify your user preferences for ValheimServerGUI by going to the following path in Windows File Explorer:

```%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Runeberry\ValheimServerGUI```

Your preferences are stored in `userprefs.json`.
